This bot watches over the shop in Wizard101 and purchases whatever items you would like it to look out for.

Requirements:
- Python
- 1440p monitor running wizard101 in fullscreen (Again, if people show interest I could update this to work on any monitor)

How to use:
- Screenshot the item for sale in the shop that you want the bot to look for
- Edit line 23 of Bot.py and input the location of the image you screenshot (I recommend moving the image to the folder of the bot)
- Run Bot.py, it'll refresh the shop based on the coordinates of the buttons on a 1440p screen in full-screen
- If it finds the item it'll buy as much of it as it can immediately

I mostly made this for myself but if enough people show interest I may update it to be easier to use

Known Issues:
- Only works on a 1440p monitor because it scans several specific locations on your monitor for the item to greatly increase the speed.
You could in theory pretty easily modify the program to work on your monitor by changing these pixel values or even making it scan the entire screen
But this will hurt the speed the program can scan pages of the Bazaar at and possibly cause you to miss out on items it normally would've gotten
- The more items you search for at once, the slower the bot runs, and therefore the fewer items it can successfully obtain on time.
I highly recommend searching for as few items at once as possible, like 1-2 items. The fewer items you search for the more likely it'll find it.

WARNING: I take no responsibility for any bans caused by using this.
I haven't heard of anyone getting banned for using Bazaar bots but using third-party apps in the game is against Wizard101 TOS.

Please be respectful when using this bot and do not buy more than you need.
